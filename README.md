# 📊 Bankruptcy Prevention - Classification Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a company will go bankrupt or not using financial and operational risk factors. It is a binary classification problem designed to assist in early risk detection and financial decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective
To build a predictive model that classifies companies as "Bankrupt" or "Non-Bankrupt" based on six risk-related features.

---

## 📊 Dataset Information
- Total Companies: 250
- Input Features: 6 numerical risk factors
- Target Variable: 1 binary variable (Bankruptcy / Non-Bankruptcy)

### Features:
- Industrial Risk  
- Management Risk  
- Financial Flexibility  
- Credibility  
- Competitiveness  
- Operating Risk  
- Class (Target Variable)
